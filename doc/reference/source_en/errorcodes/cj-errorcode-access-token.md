> The following describes only the error codes specific to this module. For general error codes, please refer to the [Universal Error Code Documentation](cj-errorcode-universal.md).

## 12100001 Invalid Parameter

**Error Message**

Parameter invalid, message is ${messageInfo}.

**Possible Causes**

This error code indicates parameter validation failure. Possible causes include:

1. The tokenId value is 0.
2. The specified permission name is empty or exceeds 256 characters in length.
3. The flag value for requesting authorization/revocation is invalid.
4. Parameter check error for registering listeners.

**Resolution**

Check input parameters and correct them to valid values.

## 12100002 tokenId Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

TokenId does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

1. The specified tokenId does not exist.
2. The process corresponding to the specified tokenId is not an application process.

**Resolution**

Check input parameters and correct them to valid values.

## 12100003 Permission Does Not Exist

**Error Message**

Permission does not exist.

**Possible Causes**

1. The specified permissionName does not exist.
2. In authorization/revocation scenarios, the specified application tokenId has not applied for the specified permissionName.
3. In permission usage record scenarios, the specified permissionName is not a user-authorized sensitive permission.

**Resolution**

Check input parameters and correct them to valid values. [Permission List](../../../application-dev/source_en/security/AccessToken/cj-app-permissions.md#application-permission-list).

## 12100004 Interface Not Used in Conjunction

**Error Message**

The interface is not used together.

**Possible Causes**

This error code indicates listener interfaces are not used in conjunction. Possible causes include:

1. The current interface is called repeatedly without proper conjunction.
2. The current interface is called standalone without proper conjunction.

**Resolution**

1. Verify whether the current interface requires conjunction usage. For example, after calling the start recording interface, the same parameters cannot be used to call it again before calling the stop recording interface.
2. Check if the current interface requires conjunction usage. For example, the stop recording interface must be called after the start recording interface, and the unregister listener interface must be called after the register listener interface.

## 12100005 Listener Limit Exceeded

**Error Message**

The number of listeners exceeds the limit.

**Possible Causes**

This error code indicates the current number of listeners exceeds the limit of 200.

**Resolution**

Promptly release unused registered listeners.

## 12100006 Specified Application Does Not Support Granting/Revoking Specified Permissions

**Error Message**

The specified application does not support the permissions granted or ungranted as specified.

**Possible Causes**

1. The input tokenId is the identity of a remote device, which does not yet support distributed authorization and revocation.
2. The specified tokenId in the input parameters is a sandbox application prohibited from applying for the specified permissions.

**Resolution**

1. Verify whether the tokenId was obtained correctly.
2. Confirm if the target sandbox application is a special restricted sandbox process, as certain sandbox modes prohibit granting most permissions.

## 12100007 System Service Exception

**Error Message**

Service is abnormal.

**Possible Causes**

This error code indicates abnormal system service operation:

1. The permission management service failed to start normally.
