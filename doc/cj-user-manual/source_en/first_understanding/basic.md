# Introduction to Cangjie Language

Cangjie Programming Language is a general-purpose programming language designed for full-scenario application development. It balances development efficiency with runtime performance while providing an excellent programming experience. Its main features include:

- **Multi-Backend Support**: Cangjie supports two backends: CJNative and CJVM. The CJNative backend compiles code into native binaries that run directly at the operating system level, while the CJVM backend compiles code into bytecode that runs on a VM (Virtual Machine). This documentation is adapted for the CJNative backend.
- **Concise and Efficient Syntax**: Cangjie offers a series of concise and efficient syntax features aimed at reducing redundancy and improving development efficiency. Examples include interpolated strings, primary constructors, Flow expressions, `match` statements, and re-exports, allowing developers to express logic with minimal code.
- **Multi-Paradigm Programming**: Cangjie supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming paradigms. It incorporates advanced functional language features such as higher-order functions, algebraic data types, pattern matching, and generics, alongside object-oriented language features like encapsulation, interfaces, inheritance, and subtype polymorphism for modular development. It also includes imperative language features such as value types and global functions for simplicity and efficiency. Developers can choose the paradigm that best suits their preferences or application scenarios.
- **Type Safety**: Cangjie is a statically and strongly typed language. It performs compile-time type checking to identify program errors early, reducing runtime risks and facilitating code maintenance. Additionally, the Cangjie compiler provides powerful type inference capabilities, minimizing the need for type annotations and improving development efficiency.
- **Memory Safety**: Cangjie supports automatic memory management and performs runtime checks for array bounds and overflow, ensuring memory safety during execution.
- **Efficient Concurrency**: Cangjie provides lightweight user-mode threads (native coroutines) and an easy-to-use concurrency programming mechanism, ensuring efficient development and execution in concurrent scenarios.
- **Language Ecosystem Compatibility**: Cangjie supports interoperability with languages like C and adopts a convenient declarative programming paradigm, enabling efficient reuse and compatibility with libraries from other languages.
- **Easy Domain Extensibility**: Cangjie offers lexically scoped macro-based metaprogramming capabilities, allowing code transformation at compile time. It also features trailing `lambda`, attributes, operator overloading, and optional keywords, enabling developers to deeply customize syntax and semantics. This facilitates the construction of Embedded Domain-Specific Languages (EDSLs).
- **Enhanced UI Development**: UI development is a critical aspect of building end-side applications. Leveraging Cangjie's metaprogramming and trailing `lambda` features, users can create declarative UI frameworks to improve development efficiency and experience.
- **Rich Built-in Libraries**: Cangjie provides a comprehensive set of built-in libraries covering data structures, common algorithms, mathematical computations, regular expression matching, system interaction, file operations, network communication, database access, logging, compression/decompression, encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption, and serialization.
