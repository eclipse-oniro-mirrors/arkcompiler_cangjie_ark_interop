# Introduction to `cjpm`

`CJPM (Cangjie Package Manager)` is the official package management tool for the Cangjie language, designed to manage and maintain the module system of Cangjie projects while providing a simpler and unified compilation entry point with support for custom compilation commands. Through automated dependency management, the package manager analyzes and merges multi-version third-party dependencies, eliminating developers' concerns about version conflicts and significantly reducing their workload. Additionally, it offers a native Cangjie language-based custom build mechanism, allowing developers to add pre-processing and post-processing workflows at different build stages. This enables flexible customization of the build process to meet various compilation requirements across different business scenarios.

## Basic Usage of `cjpm`

Run `cjpm -h` to view the main interface, which consists of several sections from top to bottom: current command description, usage examples (Usage), available subcommands (Available subcommands), supported configuration options (Available options), and additional hints.

Cangjie Package Manager

Usage:
  cjpm [subcommand] [option]

Available subcommands:
  init             Init a new cangjie module
  check            Check the dependencies
  update           Update cjpm.lock
  tree             Display the package dependencies in the source code
  build            Compile the current module
  run              Compile and run an executable product
  test             Unittest a local package or module
  bench            Run benchmarks in a local package or module
  clean            Clean up the target directory
  install          Install a cangjie binary
  uninstall        Uninstall a cangjie binary

Available options:
  -h, --help       help for cjpm
  -v, --version    version for cjpm

Use "cjpm [subcommand] --help" for more information about a command.
```

`cjpm init` initializes a new Cangjie module or workspace. When initializing a module, it creates a `cjpm.toml` file in the current directory by default, along with a `src` source code folder containing a default `main.cj` file. For custom parameter initialization, run `cjpm init -h`.

Example:

```text
Input: cjpm init
Output: cjpm init success
```

`cjpm build` compiles the current Cangjie project. Before execution, it checks dependencies and then invokes `cjc` for compilation. It supports full compilation, incremental compilation, cross-compilation, parallel compilation, etc. For more compilation features, run `cjpm build -h`. Use `cjpm build -V` to print all compilation commands.

Example:

```text
Input: cjpm build -V
Output:
compile package module1.package1: cjc --import-path target -p "src/package1" --output-type=staticlib -o target/release/module1/libmodule1.package1.a
compile package module1: cjc --import-path target -L target/release/module1 -lmodule1.package1 -p "src" --output-type=exe --output-dir target/release/bin -o main

cjpm build success
```

## `cjpm.toml` Configuration File Description

The configuration file `cjpm.toml` defines basic information, dependencies, and compilation options. `cjpm` primarily parses and executes based on this file.

Example configuration:

```text
[package] # Single-module configuration field; cannot coexist with [workspace]
  cjc-version = "1.0.0" # Minimum required `cjc` version (required)
  name = "demo" # Module name and root package name (required)
  description = "nothing here" # Description (optional)
  version = "1.0.0" # Module version (required)
  compile-option = "" # Additional compilation options (optional)

  output-type = "executable" # Compilation output type (required)
  src-dir = "" # Source code directory path (optional)
  target-dir = "" # Output directory path (optional)
  package-configuration = {} # Single-package configuration options (optional)

[workspace] # Workspace management field; cannot coexist with [package]
  members = [] # Workspace member modules (required)
  build-members = [] # Workspace compilation modules (subset of members) (optional)
  test-members = [] # Workspace test modules (subset of build-members) (optional)
  compile-option = "" # Additional compilation options for all workspace members (optional)
  override-compile-option = "" # Additional global compilation options for all workspace members (optional)
