# Using ArkTS in Cangjie Applications

The Cangjie application does not support adding ArkTS pages or ArkTS modules. When developing Cangjie applications, reuse ArkTS's rich library ecosystem by calling existing ArkTS libraries. The ArkTS library is divided into NAPI (Node.js API) module and third-party library module. Currently, Cangjie supports calling NAPI module, but does not support third-party library module. The way to call NAPI module can be found in  [Cangjie Calling ArkTS](./using_arkts_module.md).
