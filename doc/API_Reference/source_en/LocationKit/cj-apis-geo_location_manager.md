# ohos.geo_location_manager (Location Services)

Location services provide basic functionalities including GNSS positioning, network positioning (cellular base station, WLAN, Bluetooth positioning technologies), geocoding, reverse geocoding, country codes, and geofencing.

> **Note:**
>
> This module's capabilities only support the WGS-84 coordinate system.

## Importing the Module

```cangjie
import kit.LocationKit.*
```

## Permission List

Before using the Location Kit system capabilities, applications must check whether they have obtained user authorization to access device location information. If authorization has not been granted, applications can request the necessary location permissions from the user.

The system provides the following location permissions:

ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION: Used to obtain approximate location with an accuracy of 5 kilometers.

ohos.permission.LOCATION: Used to obtain precise location with meter-level accuracy.

ohos.permission.LOCATION_IN_BACKGROUND: Used for scenarios where the application needs to continue obtaining location information after switching to the background.

## Usage Instructions

API example code usage instructions:

- If the first line of the example code has a "// index.cj" comment, it indicates that the example can be compiled and run in the "index.cj" file of the Cangjie template project.
- If the example requires obtaining the [Context](../AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-ui_ability.md#class-context) application context, it needs to be configured in the "main_ability.cj" file of the Cangjie template project.

For the above example projects and configuration templates, refer to [Cangjie Example Code Instructions](../../cj-development-intro.md#cangjie-example-code-instructions).

## enum LocatingPriority

```cangjie
public enum LocatingPriority {

    | PriorityLocatingSpeed
    | ...
}
```

**Function:** Priority types in single-shot location requests.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### PriorityAccuracy

```cangjie
PriorityAccuracy
```

**Function:** Indicates accuracy priority.

The accuracy-first strategy uses both GNSS and network positioning technologies and returns the most accurate result within a period, which is the shorter of [SingleLocationRequest](#class-singlelocationrequest).locatingTimeoutMs and 30 seconds. This strategy consumes more hardware resources and power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### PriorityLocatingSpeed

```cangjie
PriorityLocatingSpeed
```

**Function:** Indicates fast location acquisition priority. If an application wants to quickly obtain a location, this priority type can be set.

The speed-first strategy uses both GNSS and network positioning technologies to quickly obtain location results in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The first obtained location result is returned to the application. This strategy consumes more hardware resources and power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

## enum LocationRequestPriority

```cangjie
public enum LocationRequestPriority {
    | Unset
    | Accuracy
    | LowPower
    | FirstFix
    | ...
}
```

**Function:** Priority types for location information in location requests.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### Accuracy

```cangjie
Accuracy
```

**Function:** Indicates accuracy priority.

The accuracy-first strategy mainly uses GNSS positioning technology. Network positioning technology is used before GNSS provides stable location results. During continuous positioning, if no GNSS location result is obtained for more than 30 seconds, network positioning technology is used. This strategy consumes more hardware resources and power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### FirstFix

```cangjie
FirstFix
```

**Function:** Indicates fast location acquisition priority. If an application wants to quickly obtain a location, this priority type can be set.

The speed-first strategy uses both GNSS and network positioning technologies to quickly obtain location results in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. When multiple positioning technologies provide location results, the system selects the most accurate one to return to the application. This strategy consumes more hardware resources and power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### LowPower

```cangjie
LowPower
```

**Function:** Indicates low power priority.

The low-power strategy uses only network positioning technology, which can provide location services in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Since it relies on the distribution of nearby base stations, visible WLANs, and Bluetooth devices, the accuracy of location results may vary significantly. This strategy is recommended for scenarios where high accuracy is not required, as it effectively reduces power consumption.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### Unset

```cangjie
Unset
```

**Function:** Indicates that the priority is not set, meaning [LocationRequestPriority](#enum-locationrequestpriority) is invalid.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

## enum LocationRequestScenario

```cangjie
public enum LocationRequestScenario {
    | Unset
    | Navigation
    | TrajectoryTracking
    | CarHailing
    | DailyLifeService
    | NoPower
    | ...
}
```

**Function:** Positioning scenario types in location requests.

> **Note:**
>
> When using Navigation/TrajectoryTracking/CarHailing scenarios for single-shot or continuous positioning, network positioning technology is used before GNSS provides stable location results. During continuous positioning, if no GNSS location result is obtained for more than 30 seconds, network positioning technology is used to obtain the location.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### CarHailing

```cangjie
CarHailing
```

**Function:** Indicates ride-hailing scenario.

Applicable to scenarios where users need to locate their current position for ride-hailing services, such as ride-hailing applications.

Mainly uses GNSS positioning technology, which consumes more power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### DailyLifeService

```cangjie
DailyLifeService
```

**Function:** Indicates daily service scenario.

Applicable to scenarios where precise user location is not required, such as news, online shopping, and food delivery applications.

This scenario uses only network positioning technology, which consumes less power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### Navigation

```cangjie
Navigation
```

**Function:** Indicates navigation scenario.

Applicable to scenarios where real-time device location is needed outdoors, such as vehicle and pedestrian navigation.

Mainly uses GNSS positioning technology, which consumes more power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### NoPower

```cangjie
NoPower
```

**Function:** Indicates no-power scenario. In this scenario, positioning is not actively triggered. Location results are returned to the current application only when other applications perform positioning.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### TrajectoryTracking

```cangjie
TrajectoryTracking
```

**Function:** Indicates trajectory tracking scenario.

Applicable to scenarios where user location trajectories need to be recorded, such as fitness applications tracking movement paths.

Mainly uses GNSS positioning technology, which consumes more power.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21

### Unset

```cangjie
Unset
```

**Function:** Indicates that the scenario is not set, meaning [LocationRequestScenario](#enum-locationrequestscenario) is invalid.

**System Capability:** SystemCapability.Location.Location.Core

**Since:** 21
