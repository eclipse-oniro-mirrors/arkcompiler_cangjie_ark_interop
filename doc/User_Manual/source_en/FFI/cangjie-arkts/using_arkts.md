# Using ArkTS in Cangjie Applications

The Cangjie application does not support adding ArkTS pages or modules, but existing ArkTS modules can be used. The ArkTS modules used are limited to system API modules only, and third-party library modules are not supported. For the method of using system API modules, please refer to [Cangjie Calling ArkTS](./using_arkts_module.md).
