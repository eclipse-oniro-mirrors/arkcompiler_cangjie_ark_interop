### Providing Feedback on Document Issues

High-quality feedback helps us continuously improve the content and quality of the documentation. The more detailed the information you provide, the more helpful it is for us to improve the issues.

1. In the corresponding repository on GitCode, go to the "Issues" tab, click "New issue," describe the issue in the title bar, and add a detailed description of the problem in the editing box.
2. Click the "New issue" button to submit your issue. Please wait patiently for the members of the Cangjie Document team to confirm your problem.

> **How to Provide High-Quality Feedback?**
>
> - Provide the specific location, name of the document, and a clear description of the issue. Specify the missing or incorrect content or the text that needs improvement, and provide screenshots if necessary.
> - Explain the impact of the issue on users.
> - If the issue is with a document example, provide the specific Cangjie version, environment, and error message.
> - Limit the scope of the given issue to a specific content or task. If the issue involves a broad area, break it down into smaller issues. For example, "The documentation needs optimization" is too broad, while "The XX development guide lacks an introduction to the XXX steps" is a specific and actionable issue.
> - Search the existing issue list to see if a related or similar issue has already been recorded.
> - If the new issue is related to another issue or PR, you can reference it using its full URL or the PR number with the \# character.
