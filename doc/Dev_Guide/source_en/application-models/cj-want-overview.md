# Want Overview

## Definition and Usage of Want

[Want](../../../API_Reference/source_en/apis/AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-want.md#class-want) is an object used for transferring information between application components.

One common usage scenario is as a parameter for the [startAbility()](../../../API_Reference/source_en/apis/AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-ui_ability.md#func-startabilitywant-startOptions) method. For example, when UIAbilityA needs to start UIAbilityB and pass some data to UIAbilityB, Want can serve as a carrier to transfer the data to UIAbilityB.

## Types of Want

- **Explicit Want**: When starting a target application component, if the caller specifies both abilityName and bundleName in the [Want](../../../API_Reference/source_en/apis/AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-want.md#class-want) parameter, it is called an Explicit Want.

    Explicit Want is typically used for launching components within the same application by specifying the target component's bundle name (bundleName) and abilityName in the Want object. When there is a clearly identified target component to handle the request, Explicit Want provides a straightforward and effective way to start the target application component.

  <!-- compile -->

  ```cangjie
  import kit.AbilityKit.Want

  let wantInfo = Want(deviceId: "", bundleName: "com.example.myapplication", abilityName: "FuncAbility")
  ```

- **Implicit Want**: When starting a target application component, if the caller does not specify abilityName in the [Want](../../../API_Reference/source_en/apis/AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-want.md#class-want) parameter, it is called an Implicit Want.

    When the target component is not explicitly identified, Implicit Want can be used to leverage capabilities provided by other applications without needing to know which specific application provides the capability. Implicit Want uses the [skills tag](../cj-start/basic-knowledge/module-configuration-file.md#skills标签) to define the required capability, and the system matches all applications that declare support for the request to handle it. For example, when opening a link, the system matches all applications that declare support for the request and lets the user choose which application to use.

  <!-- compile -->

  ```cangjie
  import kit.AbilityKit.Want

  // uncomment line below if wish to implicitly query only in the specific bundle.
  // bundleName: 'com.example.myapplication'
  let wantInfo = Want(action: "ohos.want.action.search",
      // entities can be omitted
      entities: ["entity.system.browsable"],
      uri: "https://www.test.com:8080/query/student",
      wantType: "text/plain")
  ```

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Depending on the matching results of target application components in the system, the following three scenarios may occur when using Implicit Want to start an application component.
    >
    > - No matching application component is found: The startup fails.
    > - One matching application component is found: The component is launched directly.
    > - Multiple matching application components are found ([UIAbility](../../../API_Reference/source_en/apis/AbilityKit/cj-apis-app-ability-ui_ability.md#class-uiability)): A selection dialog pops up for the user to choose.
