# Stage Model Application Configuration File

The application configuration file contains application configuration information, component information, permission details, and developer-defined information. This data is provided to compilation tools, app markets, and the operating system during compilation, distribution, and runtime respectively.

In Stage model-based application projects, there are two types of configuration files: app.json5 (one file) and module.json5 (one or multiple files). For common configuration items, please refer to [Application/Component-Level Configuration](cj-application-component-configuration-stage.md). For more detailed information about these configuration files, see [Application Configuration File Overview (Stage Model)](../cj-start/basic-knowledge/application-configuration-file-overview-stage.md).
