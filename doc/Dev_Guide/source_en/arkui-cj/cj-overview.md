# Introduction to ArkUI

ArkUI (Ark UI Framework) provides a comprehensive infrastructure for application UI development, including concise UI syntax, rich UI functionalities (components, layouts, animations, and interaction events), as well as real-time interface preview tools, supporting developers in visual interface development.

## Basic Concepts

- **UI:** Stands for User Interface. Developers can design an application's user interface as multiple functional pages, with each page managed in separate files.

- **Component:** The smallest unit for UI construction and display, such as grids, buttons, etc. By combining various components, developers can build complete interfaces that meet their application requirements.

## Development Paradigms

The Ark UI Framework offers a [Cangjie-based Declarative Development Paradigm](./cj-ui-development-overview.md) (referred to as the "Declarative Development Paradigm"), suitable for different application scenarios and technical backgrounds. This paradigm employs Cangjie's declarative UI syntax, providing UI rendering capabilities from three dimensions: components, animations, and state management.
