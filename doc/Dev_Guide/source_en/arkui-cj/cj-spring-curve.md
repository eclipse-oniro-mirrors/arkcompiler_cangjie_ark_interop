# Spring Curve

In a damped spring system (referred to as a spring curve), an object displaced from its equilibrium position is subjected to two forces: a restoring force generated by the spring deformation, which causes the object to oscillate, and a damping force that provides resistance to the oscillation. Except in the special case where damping is zero, the amplitude of the object's oscillation continuously decreases and eventually approaches zero. The corresponding animation curve naturally exhibits smooth continuity.

Animations using spring curves reach a velocity of zero at their endpoint, avoiding the abrupt "sudden stop" effect that could negatively impact user experience.

ArkUI provides four types of spring curve interfaces:

- [springMotion](../../../API_Reference/source_en/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-springmotionfloat32-float32-float32): Creates an elastic animation where the duration is automatically calculated based on curve parameters, the magnitude of property changes, and the initial spring velocity. The duration specified by the developer will not take effect.<br> springMotion does not provide a velocity setting interface, as the velocity is inherited and does not need to be specified by the developer. For a given property, if there is an ongoing springMotion or responsiveSpringMotion animation, the newly created spring animation will stop the running animation and inherit its current property value and velocity as the initial state of the new animation. Additionally, the interface provides default parameters for ease of use.

    ```cangjie
    public static func springMotion(response!: Float32 = 0.55, damping!: Float32 = 0.825, overlapDuration!: Float32 = 0.0): ICurve
    ```

- [responsiveSpringMotion](../../../API_Reference/source_en/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-responsivespringmotionfloat32-float32-float32): A special case of springMotion animation with different default parameters. It is typically used for follow-through animation scenarios. When releasing the touch, a springMotion animation can be created, and the release-phase animation will automatically inherit the velocity from the follow-phase animation to ensure smooth transitions.<br> If the overlapDuration parameter of the new animation is non-zero and the previous springMotion animation for the property has not yet ended, the response and dampingFraction will transition from the old animation's parameters to the new animation's parameters over the specified overlapDuration.

    ```cangjie
    public static func responsiveSpringMotion(response!: Float32 = 0.15, dampingFraction!: Float32 = 0.86, overlapDuration!: Float32 = 0.25): ICurve
    ```

- [interpolatingSpring](../../../API_Reference/source_en/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-interpolatingspringfloat32-float32-float32-float32): Suitable for scenarios requiring specified initial velocity. The animation duration is also automatically calculated based on interface parameters, and the duration specified by the developer in the animation interface will not take effect.<br> This curve interface provides a velocity parameter. Since the interface corresponds to a damped spring curve from 0 to 1, the actual animation value is calculated through interpolation. Therefore, the velocity should be normalized, equal to the absolute velocity of the property change divided by the magnitude of the property change. This makes it unsuitable for scenarios where the start and end property values are the same, as the property change magnitude would be zero, rendering the normalized velocity undefined.

    ```cangjie
    public static func interpolatingSpring(velocity: Float32, mass: Float32, stiffness: Float32, damping: Float32): ICurve
    ```

- [springCurve](../../../API_Reference/source_en/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-springcurvefloat32-float32-float32-float32): Suitable for scenarios requiring direct specification of animation duration. The springCurve interface is almost identical to interpolatingSpring, but for animations using springCurve, the physical duration of the curve is mapped to the specified duration, effectively stretching or compressing the curve on the time axis. This disrupts the original physical properties of the curve, so its use is not recommended.

    ```cangjie
    public static func springCurve(velocity: Float32, mass: Float32, stiffness: Float32, damping: Float32): ICurve
    ```
