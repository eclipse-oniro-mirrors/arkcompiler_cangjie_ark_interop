# Spring Curve

In a damped spring system corresponding to the spring curve, an object displaced from its equilibrium position is subjected to two forces: a restoring force generated by the spring deformation that causes vibration, and damping that provides resistance to the oscillation. Except in the special case where damping is zero, the amplitude of the object's vibration continuously decreases during oscillation and eventually approaches zero. The resulting motion trajectory naturally produces a smooth and continuous animation curve.

Animations using spring curves reach zero velocity at their endpoints, avoiding abrupt stops that could negatively impact user experience.

ArkUI provides four spring curve interfaces:

- [springMotion](../../../API_Reference/source_zh_cn/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-springmotionfloat32-float32-float32): Creates elastic animations where duration is automatically calculated based on curve parameters, property change magnitude, and initial spring velocity. Developer-specified animation durations are ignored.<br> springMotion doesn't provide velocity setting interfaces - velocity is inherited automatically without developer specification. For any property, if there's an ongoing springMotion or responsiveSpringMotion animation, newly created spring animations will terminate the running animation and inherit its current property values and velocity as initial states. Default parameters are provided for ease of use.

     
    ```cangjie
    public static func springMotion(response!: Float32 = 0.55, damping!: Float32 = 0.825, overlapDuration!: Float32 = 0.0): ICurve
    ```

- [responsiveSpringMotion](../../../API_Reference/source_zh_cn/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-responsivespringmotionfloat32-float32-float32): A specialized version of springMotion with different default parameters, typically used for touch-following animations. When releasing touch, springMotion can create animations that automatically inherit velocity from the touch-following phase for smooth transitions.<br> When overlapDuration â‰  0 and the previous springMotion animation hasn't completed, response and dampingFraction parameters will transition from old to new values over the specified overlapDuration period.

     
    ```cangjie
    public static func responsiveSpringMotion(response!: Float32 = 0.15, dampingFraction!: Float32 = 0.86, overlapDuration!: Float32 = 0.25): ICurve
    ```

- [interpolatingSpring](../../../API_Reference/source_zh_cn/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-interpolatingspringfloat32-float32-float32-float32): Suitable for scenarios requiring specified initial velocity. Animation duration is automatically calculated by interface parameters, overriding developer-specified durations.<br> This interface accepts velocity input and produces a damped spring curve from 0 to 1, with actual animation values calculated through interpolation. Velocity should be normalized (absolute velocity divided by property change magnitude), making it unsuitable for scenarios where start and end property values are identical (resulting in zero property change and undefined normalized velocity).

     
    ```cangjie
    public static func interpolatingSpring(velocity: Float32, mass: Float32, stiffness: Float32, damping: Float32): ICurve
    ```

- [springCurve](../../../API_Reference/source_zh_cn/arkui-cj/cj-apis-curves.md#static-func-springcurvefloat32-float32-float32-float32): Designed for scenarios requiring explicit animation duration specification. While nearly identical to interpolatingSpring, springCurve maps the physical duration to specified durations by stretching/compressing the timeline, thereby violating the original physical laws of the curve. Its use is generally discouraged.

     
    ```cangjie
    public static func springCurve(velocity: Float32, mass: Float32, stiffness: Float32, damping: Float32): ICurve
