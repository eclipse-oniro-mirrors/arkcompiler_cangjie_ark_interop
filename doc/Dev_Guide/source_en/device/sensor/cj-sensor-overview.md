# Sensor Development Overview

## Sensor Types

System sensors are device abstractions that allow applications to access underlying hardware sensors. By utilizing the [Sensor interface](../../../../API_Reference/source_en/SensorServiceKit/cj-apis-sensor.md), developers can query device sensors, subscribe to sensor data, and develop various applications with customized algorithms based on sensor data, such as compasses, fitness trackers, and games.

## Operational Mechanism

Sensors consist of four modules: Sensor API, Sensor Framework, Sensor Service, and HDF layer.

- **Sensor API**: Provides fundamental sensor APIs, including querying sensor lists, subscribing/unsubscribing to sensor data, and executing control commands, simplifying application development.
- **Sensor Framework**: Manages sensor subscriptions, creates/destroys data channels, and handles communication with SensorService.
- **Sensor Service**: Implements HD_IDL layer data reception, parsing, and distribution; manages foreground/background policies, device sensors, and permission control.
- **HDF Layer**: Selects strategies for different FIFOs and frequencies, and adapts to various devices.

## Constraints and Limitations

1. For the sensors listed below, developers must request corresponding permissions to access sensor data.

   | Sensor  | Permission Name  | Sensitivity Level  | Description  |
   | ------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
   | Accelerometer, Uncalibrated Accelerometer, Linear Accelerometer | ohos.permission.ACCELEROMETER  | system_grant | Allows applications to read accelerometer data, including: accelerometer, uncalibrated accelerometer, and linear accelerometer. |
   | Gyroscope, Uncalibrated Gyroscope    | ohos.permission.GYROSCOPE   | system_grant | Allows applications to read gyroscope data, including: gyroscope and uncalibrated gyroscope. |
   | Pedometer        | ohos.permission.ACTIVITY_MOTION  | user_grant   | Allows applications to read user motion states, such as detecting movement or counting steps. |
   | Heart Rate Sensor         | ohos.permission.READ_HEALTH_DATA | user_grant   | Allows applications to read user health data, such as heart rate.  |

2. Sensor data subscription and unsubscription interfaces must be called in pairs. Developers must call the unsubscription interface to stop data reporting when sensor data is no longer needed.
