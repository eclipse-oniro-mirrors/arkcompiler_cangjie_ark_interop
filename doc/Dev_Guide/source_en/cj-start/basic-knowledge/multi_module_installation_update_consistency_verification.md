# Application Installation and Update Consistency Verification

As applications grow increasingly complex, they are often divided into multiple modules for development and maintenance, with different teams responsible for individual or multiple modules. During installation and updates, applications perform consistency verification and validation on various fields to ensure security and legitimacy. This document outlines the consistency verification rules for signature certificates and configuration files during multi-module installation or updates.

> **Note**
>
> A matching `versionCode` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件) indicates that the installation or update package is of the same version; otherwise, it is considered a different version.
>
> If a packaging tool is used, legitimacy verification occurs during the packaging process. For details, refer to the [Packaging Tool](../../tools/cj-packing-tool.md#打包工具).

## Signature Certificate Consistency Verification

| Field Name | Description | Installation Consistency Verification Rule | Update Consistency Verification Rule |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| appId | The application's appId, composed as `bundleName_base64EncodedPublicKey`. | Yes | Either `appId` or `appIdentifier` must match. |
| appIdentifier | The unique identifier of the application, assigned as an [APP ID](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/app/agc-help-createharmonyapp-0000001945392297) when creating the app in AppGallery Connect. It is a randomly generated string uniformly assigned by the cloud. This ID remains unchanged throughout the application's lifecycle, including version upgrades, certificate changes, developer key changes, and application transfers. | Yes | Either `appId` or `appIdentifier` must match. |
| appDistributionType | The `app-distribution-type` in the application's [signature certificate](../../../../API_Reference/source_en/AbilityKit/cj-apis-bundle_manager.md#let-appdistributiontype), indicating the distribution type of the application. | Yes | No verification for different versions; verification required for the same version. |
| appProvisionType | The [certificate type](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/app/agc-help-add-debugprofile-0000001914423102) of the application signature, categorized as `debug` or `release`. `debug` is for local debugging, while `release` is for app store distribution. | Yes | No verification for different versions; verification required for the same version. |
| apl | Represents the application's [APL level](../../security/AccessToken/cj-app-permission-mgmt-overview.md#权限机制中的基本概念). System-defined APLs include `normal`, `system_basic`, and `system_core`. | Yes | No verification for different versions; verification required for the same version. |

## Configuration File Consistency Verification

| Field Name | Description | Installation Consistency Verification Rule | Update Consistency Verification Rule |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| bundleName | Identifies the bundle name of the application, ensuring uniqueness. This field is sourced from the `bundleName` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| versionCode | Indicates the version number of the application, a positive integer less than 2^31. This number is solely used to determine whether one version is newer than another, with higher values indicating newer versions. Developers can set this to any positive integer but must ensure newer versions use larger values than older ones. This field is sourced from the `versionCode` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| apiReleaseType | Indicates the SDK release type used to compile the HAP. If the application is not installed on the device and contains multiple module packages installed sequentially, consistency is not verified. This field is sourced from the `apiReleaseType` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | No | Yes |
| singleton | Indicates whether the application is installed under user 0. | No | Yes |
| appType | Indicates the type of application, categorized as `SYSTEM_APP` (system application), `THIRD_SYSTEM_APP` (third-party system application), or `THIRD_PARTY_APP` (third-party application). | Yes | Yes |
| isStage | Indicates whether the application uses the Stage model. | Yes (FA and Stage models cannot change for the same version) | Yes |
| targetBundleName | Specifies the target application for the current package. Applications with this field configured have overlay characteristics. This field is sourced from the `targetBundleName` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| targetPriority | Indicates the priority of the current application. This field is sourced from the `targetPriority` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| bundleType | Indicates the type of application. This field is sourced from the `bundleType` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| installationFree | Indicates whether installation-free is supported. This field is sourced from the `installationFree` field in the [module.json5 configuration file](./module-configuration-file.md#modulejson5配置文件). | Yes | Yes |
| debug | Indicates whether debugging is enabled (IDE breakpoint debugging). This field is sourced from the `debug` field in the [app.json5 configuration file](./app-configuration-file.md#appjson5配置文件). | Yes | No |
| moduleType | Indicates the type of application package. Only one module type is allowed per module in the application. This field is sourced from the `type` field in the [module.json5 configuration file](./module-configuration-file.md#modulejson5配置文件). | Yes (for the same version, the `moduleName` of the `entry` type cannot be modified) | Yes |
