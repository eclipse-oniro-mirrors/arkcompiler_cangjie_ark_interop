# Application Development Guide

The application development documentation is designed to guide developers in completing application development using the open capabilities provided by the OpenHarmony SDK. Before using the application development documentation, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the complete journey of OpenHarmony application development through the [Knowledge Map](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/app/knowledge-map/).

In the application development documentation, you can access the following content.

## Getting Started

The Getting Started section helps developers understand the fundamental methods of application development.

Through learning and initial practice of this section, developers can quickly build their first OpenHarmony application, grasp the structure of application packages, the use of resource files, as well as the core functionalities and syntax of Cangjie (ArkUI), laying a solid foundation for subsequent application development.

## Development

Starting from API version 18, the OpenHarmony SDK provides rich and comprehensive open capabilities categorized by Kit, covering five major domains: application framework, system, media, graphics, and application services. For example:

- **Application Framework-related Kit Open Capabilities**: Ability Kit (program framework services), ArkUI (Ark UI framework), etc.
- **System-related Kit Open Capabilities**: Universal Keystore Kit (key management services), Network Kit (network services), etc.
- **Media-related Kit Open Capabilities**: Audio Kit (audio services), Media Library Kit (media file management services), etc.
- **Graphics-related Kit Open Capabilities**: ArkGraphics 2D (Ark 2D graphics services).
- **Application Service-related Kit Open Capabilities**: Contacts Kit (contact services), Location Kit (location services), etc.

We provide development guidance for key open capabilities to assist developers in efficient development. For details, please refer to the relevant content under the **Development** directory on the left side of this page.

## API Reference

The API Reference provides comprehensive documentation on the components and interfaces of each Kit's open capabilities in the OpenHarmony SDK. It helps developers quickly locate detailed descriptions and invocation methods for specific interfaces. For details, please refer to the API Reference.
