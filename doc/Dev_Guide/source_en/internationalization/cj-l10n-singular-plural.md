# Support for Singular and Plural Forms

During the translation process, different languages have varying requirements for singular and plural forms of nouns or unit expressions. Some languages do not distinguish between singular and plural, while others have multiple forms. For example, in English, nouns support both singular and plural forms, whereas in Chinese, nouns do not differentiate between singular and plural, and quantity is expressed through measure words.

Internationally, the following categories are commonly used to distinguish singular and plural forms:

- zero: 0 or ends with 0  
- one: singular or ends with 1  
- two: ends with 2  
- few: small numbers  
- many: large numbers  
- other: other cases  

For example, in Arabic, the singular and plural rules are as follows:

- zero: 0  
- one: 1  
- two: 2  
- few: 3 ~ 10, 103 ~ 110, 1003...  
- many: 11 ~ 26, 111, 1011...  
- other: 100 ~ 102, 200 ~ 202, 1000, 10000...
