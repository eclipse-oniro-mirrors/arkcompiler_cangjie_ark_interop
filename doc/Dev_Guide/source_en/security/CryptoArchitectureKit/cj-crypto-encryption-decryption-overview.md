# Introduction to Encryption and Decryption

In scenarios involving data storage or transmission, encryption and decryption operations can be employed to ensure data confidentiality and prevent the leakage of sensitive information.

Typical use cases for encryption and decryption operations include:

1. Encryption and decryption operations using symmetric keys.

2. Encryption and decryption operations using asymmetric keys.

3. When using RSA (with PKCS1_OAEP padding mode), obtaining and setting CipherSpecItem parameters.
