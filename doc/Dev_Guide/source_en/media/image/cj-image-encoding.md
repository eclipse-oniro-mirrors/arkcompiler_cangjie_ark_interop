# Using ImagePacker for Image Encoding

Image encoding refers to the process of encoding a PixelMap into archived images of different formats. Currently supported formats include JPEG, WebP, PNG, and HEIF (support varies across different hardware devices), which can be used for subsequent processing such as storage and transmission.

## Development Procedure

For detailed information about image encoding APIs, refer to: [Image Encoding Interface Documentation](../../../../reference/source_en/ImageKit/cj-apis-image.md#class-imagepacker).

### Encoding Images into File Streams

1. Create an ImagePacker object for image encoding.

    <!-- compile -->

    ```cangjie
    // Import relevant module packages.
    import kit.ImageKit.*

    let imagePackerApi = createImagePacker()
    ```

2. Set the encoding output stream and encoding parameters.

    - format specifies the image encoding format; quality indicates image quality, ranging from 0-100 with 100 being the best quality.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > According to MIME standards, the standard encoding format is image/jpeg. When using image encoding, set PackingOption.format to image/jpeg. The file extension for encoded images can be .jpg or .jpeg, which can be used on platforms supporting image/jpeg decoding.

        <!-- compile -->

        ```cangjie
        var packOpts = PackingOption('image/jpeg', 98)
        ```

    - Encode as HDR content (requires the source to be HDR, supports JPEG format).

        <!-- compile -->

        ```cangjie
        packOpts.desiredDynamicRange = image.PackingDynamicRange.Auto;
        ```

3. [Create a PixelMap object or create an ImageSource object](./cj-image-decoding.md).

4. Perform image encoding and save the encoded image.

    Method 1: Encode via PixelMap.

    <!-- compile -->

    ```cangjie
    // data is the file stream obtained from packing. Writing it to a file will save the image.
    let data = imagePackerApi.packToData(pixelMap, packOpts)
    ```

    Method 2: Encode via ImageSource.

    <!-- compile -->

    ```cangjie
    // data is the file stream obtained from packing. Writing it to a file will save the image.
    let data = imagePackerApi.packToData(imageSource, packOpts)
    ```

### Encoding Images into Files

During encoding, developers can specify a file path, and the encoded memory data will be directly written to the file.

Method 1: Encode PixelMap into a file.

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
import kit.CoreFileKit.*

var abilityContext = Global.abilityContext
// Get the resourceManager.
let resourceManager = abilityContext.resourceManager   
        
let img = resourceManager.getMediaContent(@r(app.media.layered_image))
let imageSource = createImageSource(img)
let cacheDir = "/data/storage/el2/base/haps/entry/cache"
let filePath = cacheDir + '/test.jpg'

let file = FileIo.open(path, mode: OpenMode.CREATE | OpenMode.READ_WRITE)
// Directly encode into the file.
imagePackerApi.packToFile(pixelMap, Int32(file.fd), packOpts)
FileFs.close(file.fd)
```

Method 2: Encode ImageSource into a file.

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
import kit.CoreFileKit.*

var abilityContext = Global.abilityContext
// Get the resourceManager.
let resourceManager = abilityContext.resourceManager   
        
let img = resourceManager.getMediaContent(@r(app.media.layered_image))
let imageSource = createImageSource(img)
let cacheDir = "/data/storage/el2/base/haps/entry/cache"
let filePath = cacheDir + '/test.jpg'

let file = FileIo.open(path, mode: OpenMode.CREATE | OpenMode.READ_WRITE)
// Directly encode into the file.
imagePackerApi.packToFile(imageSource, Int32(file.fd), packOpts)
FileFs.close(file.fd)
```
