# Providing Translation Context

The same content may yield different translation results depending on varying scenarios and contexts. When providing interface strings for translation, it is essential to furnish translators with comprehensive contextual information to prevent translation deviations. Translation context information typically includes the following two types:

1. **Annotations or remarks in string resource files**, covering:
   - Contextual scenarios
   - Part of speech
   - Key term definitions
   - Maximum allowable text length for controls
   - Variable meanings and their value ranges

2. **Interface screenshots**
