# Overview of Internationalization and Localization

Users from different regions have diverse languages and cultural backgrounds, with some speaking multiple languages. Therefore, when releasing application versions for various regions, it is essential to fully account for differences in language, region, and culture. Through the processes of internationalization and localization, the application interface can be tailored to align with local user habits, thereby expanding its potential market.

**Internationalization (I18n)** is a system-provided capability set that supports configuring regional characteristics, time zones, daylight saving time, and more to meet the design requirements of multilingual and multicultural applications. Regional characteristics include settings for date and time formats, numbers and units of measurement, phone numbers, calendars, languages, etc. Time zone and daylight saving time capabilities involve obtaining time zones and handling daylight saving transitions. Internationalization is typically implemented during the application design and development phase, where the user's language is not predetermined, and a universal design approach is adopted.

To ensure applications can operate in different markets, internationalization provides development guidelines, including:
- Avoid making assumptions about users' cultures and habits. For example, do not assume all regions use commas as numeric grouping separators and hardcode them in the code.
- UI elements (e.g., images, strings) should be separated from the code logic as application resources. When creating versions for other regions, only the corresponding resources need translation, eliminating the need to modify the code logic. This improves efficiency and avoids redesigning or redeveloping the application.

**Localization (L10n)** occurs during the application customization phase, where developers tailor the application to meet the linguistic and cultural needs of users in specific regions. This involves translating and customizing the application for target languages, including configuring multilingual resources, conducting sensitivity and taboo checks, and testing.

Configuring multilingual resources involves setting up content for different countries, regions, and languages so the application interface displays content aligned with local usage habits. Resource translation is a fundamental step in localization, where translated resources form multilingual assets, including UI element translations and code translations. The principle of separating UI elements from code logic is adopted to simplify translation. After translation, UI elements are loaded into corresponding language-specific resource files based on their types (e.g., images, audio/video). When the interface loads resources, it displays the appropriate content according to the application's language list.

The localization process also includes sensitivity and taboo checks as well as testing. Sensitivity and taboo checks involve reviewing the content displayed in the user interface to ensure it does not include politically, religiously, or culturally inappropriate material that could cause public relations issues. Testing refers to developers using system localization testing capabilities to verify:
- Untranslated strings
- Translation accuracy
- Interface layout and display compliance with local user habits.
