# Development Guide for Requesting Location Permissions

## Scenario Overview

Before using the [Location Kit](../../../reference/source_en/LocationKit/cj-apis-geo_location_manager.md) system capability, an application needs to verify whether it has obtained user authorization to access device location information. If authorization has not been granted, the application can request the required location permissions from the user.

The system provides the following location permissions:

- ohos.permission.LOCATION: Used to obtain precise location with meter-level accuracy.

- ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION: Used to obtain approximate location with an accuracy of 5 kilometers.

- ohos.permission.LOCATION_IN_BACKGROUND: Used for scenarios where the application needs to continue obtaining location information after switching to the background.

For permission requirements of Location Kit interfaces, refer to: [Location Kit](../../../reference/source_en/LocationKit/cj-apis-geo_location_manager.md).

## Development Steps

1. Developers can declare the required permissions in the application configuration file and request user authorization. For details, refer to [Requesting User Authorization](../security/AccessToken/cj-request-user-authorization.md#requesting-user-authorization).

2. When the app runs in the foreground and accesses device location information, the methods for requesting location permissions are as follows:

   | Method for Requesting Location Permissions | Allowed to Request | Location Accuracy After Successful Request |
   | -------- | -------- | -------- |
   | Request ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION | Yes | Obtain approximate location with an accuracy of 5 kilometers. |
   | Request both ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION and ohos.permission.LOCATION | Yes | Obtain precise location with meter-level accuracy. |
