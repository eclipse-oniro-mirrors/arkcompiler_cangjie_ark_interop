# Animation Curve Overview  

An animation curve is a function that describes how a property changes over time, determining the motion trajectory when the property is animated. The slope of the animation curve at a given moment represents the animation speed, indicating how fast the property changes. A well-designed animation curve should be smooth, continuous, aligned with user intent, and adhere to the laws of the physical world. Developers can select appropriate animation curves for effects based on user scenarios and intentions.  

Depending on whether the animation curve conforms to the laws of the physical world, it can be categorized into two types: physical curves (ArkUI currently provides various physical spring curves) and traditional curves. Compared to traditional curves, motion trajectories generated by physical curves better align with user cognition, helping to create natural and vivid animation effects. Developers are encouraged to prioritize the use of physical curves.
