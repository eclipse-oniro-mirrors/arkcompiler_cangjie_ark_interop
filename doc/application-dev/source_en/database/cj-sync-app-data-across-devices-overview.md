# Overview of Cross-Device Data Synchronization Within the Same Application

## Scenario Introduction

Cross-device data synchronization functionality (also known as distributed functionality) refers to synchronizing data to other devices within a networked environment. It is commonly used for freely synchronizing, modifying, and querying user application data content across different devices with trusted authentication.

For example: When Application A on Device 1 adds, deletes, or modifies data in a distributed database, Application A on Device 2 can also detect these database changes. This functionality can be applied in scenarios such as distributed photo galleries, memos, contacts, file managers, etc.

Based on the lifecycle of cross-device synchronized data, it can be categorized into:

- **Temporary Data**: Has a shorter lifecycle and is typically stored in memory. For example, process data generated by gaming applications is recommended to use distributed data objects.
- **Persistent Data**: Has a longer lifecycle and needs to be stored in a database. Depending on data relationships and characteristics, either a relational database or a key-value database can be chosen. For instance, attributes like albums, covers, and images in a photo gallery application are recommended to use a relational database, while specific image thumbnails are recommended to use a key-value database.

## Basic Concepts

In distributed scenarios involving multiple devices, the consistency of data seen across networked devices is referred to as **distributed database consistency**.

Distributed database consistency can be classified into:
- **Strong Consistency**: Ensures that after a device successfully adds, deletes, or modifies data, any device in the network can immediately read the updated value.
- **Weak Consistency**: After a device successfully modifies data, other devices in the network may or may not read the updated data, with no guarantee on when all devices will eventually have consistent data.
- **Eventual Consistency**: After a device successfully modifies data, other devices may not immediately read the updated data, but after a certain time window, all devices in the network will achieve a consistent state.

Strong consistency imposes very high requirements on distributed data management and is typically encountered in server-based distributed scenarios. Due to the intermittent connectivity and decentralized nature of mobile devices, cross-device data synchronization within the same application does not support strong consistency but only eventual consistency.

## Cross-Device Synchronization Access Control Mechanism

During cross-device data synchronization, data management employs access control based on device levels and data security labels.
