# User File Overview  

User Files: Files owned by users logged into the terminal device, including private audio, documents, etc.  

1. User files are stored in the user directory and belong to the user logged into the device.  

2. User file storage locations are primarily divided into [Internal Storage](#internal-storage) and [External Storage](#external-storage).  

3. Applications require prior user authorization or user-initiated actions to create, access, or delete user files.  

## User File Storage Locations  

### Internal Storage  

Internal storage refers to user files stored on the device's built-in storage (space). The internal storage device cannot be removed. User files in internal storage mainly include:  

- **User-specific files**: These files belong to the user logged into the device. Different users can only see their own files after logging in. Based on file characteristics/attributes and user/application usage habits, they can be categorized as:  
    - **Audio media files**:  
        These files have attributes such as album, creator, duration, etc., and are stored in the system as media files. They are typically displayed externally in forms like "All Files," "Albums," or "Artists," without revealing their specific storage locations in the system.  

    - **Other files (collectively referred to as document-type files)**:  
        These are stored in the system as regular files. This category includes plain text files, compressed files, as well as image/video/audio files stored as regular files. Such files are usually displayed externally in a directory tree structure.  

- **Multi-user shared files**: Users can place files in a shared file area to enable shared access among multiple users.  
  Files in the shared file area are also stored in the system as regular files and displayed externally in a directory tree structure.  

### External Storage  

External storage refers to user files stored on removable external devices (e.g., SD cards, USB drives, etc.). Files on external storage devices, like those in the shared area of internal storage, are visible to all users logged into the system.  

Files on external storage devices are all presented as regular files, similar to document-type files on internal storage, and are displayed externally in a directory tree structure.
